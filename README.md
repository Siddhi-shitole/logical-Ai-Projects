# logical-Ai-Projects

This repository contains research and open-source projects that integrate **Machine Learning (ML)** with **Temporal Logic Reasoning**, leveraging tools such as [PyReason](https://github.com/nasa/pyreason), PyTorch, NumPy, and LangChain. The projects aim to enhance automated reasoning over temporal and uncertain events.

### 1. ML-Enhanced Temporal Logic Reasoning
**Technologies:** Python, PyReason, PyTorch, NumPy, Numba  

- Integrated supervised ML models (Random Forests, Neural Networks) with PyReason to enhance **probabilistic temporal logic reasoning**.  
- Developed preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines for **temporal event datasets** to improve model accuracy.  
- Combined ML predictions with PyReasonâ€™s annotated logic framework for reasoning under **uncertainty**.  
- Implemented performance optimizations using **Numba** and vectorized **NumPy**, reducing runtime by **30%+**.  
- Validated reasoning outcomes on benchmark temporal datasets and conducted **error analysis** to refine ML models and logic rules.

### 2. Natural Language â†’ Temporal Logic Translator
**Technologies:** Python, PyReason, LangChain, OpenAI API  

- Built a pipeline that translates **unstructured natural language statements** into **PyReason-compatible logic programs**.  
- Leveraged **LLMs (GPT-4 via LangChain)** to parse natural language queries and generate structured logic rules.  
- Implemented **temporal relation extraction, dependency parsing, and probabilistic annotation** of events.  
- Ensured correctness with **unit tests, reproducibility checks**, and documentation for future contributors.  
- Strengthened the open-source PyReason ecosystem with reproducible workflows and test suites.
